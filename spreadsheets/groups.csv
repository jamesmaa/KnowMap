1,Computer Security,2,,"Computer Security is the branch of computer science that focuses on protecting a user's confidentiality, integrity, and availability in a variety of contexts.",
2,Software Security,"3,8,12",,Computer security is a broad topic that involves the prevention of misuse of a software system.,
3,Control Hijacking,"4,6",,The ability to change the flow of a program to possibly execute arbitrary code.,
4,Control Hijacking Techniques,5,"1000,1004,1005,1006,1007",Learning about the various techniques to change the flow of a program,
5,Buffer Overflow,,"1001,1002,1003","A technique where a program writes and ""overflows"" its allocated space of memory into another.",
6,Control Hijacking Defenses,,"1008,1009,1010,1011,1012",Learning about the different techniques to defend against a control hijacking attack,
8,Program Analysis and Verification,"9,10,11",,Automatically analyzing a program for different reasons i.e. vulnerability checking,
9,Static Analysis,,"1013,1014,1015",Analysis performed without executing the program being analyzed,
10,Dynamic Analysis,,"1016,1017,1018",Analysis performed by executing the program being analyzed,
11,Soundness and Completeness,,"1019,1020","Soundness is when program says an error and analysis gives warning, Completeness is when analysis gives error and code contains error.",
12,Security Principles and Mechanisms,"13,22",,TODO,
13,Security Principles,14,"1031,1032",Security Principles are broad architectural design goals that help to mitigate attacks on software security.,
14,Isolation,"15,16,17,18,19,20,21",,"Isolation is the separation of components from one another, with the intent that a successful security attack in one component will not compromise the security of other components.",
15,Levels of Implementation,,,"Isolation can be implemented in several different ""Levels"" of the software stack: Hardware, Virtual Machine, Process, Thread, and Aplication.",
16,HW,,1021,The hardware level at which isolation can be implemented involves physically separating two components of a larger system.,
17,VM,,"1022,1023,1024,1025,1026,1027,1028","The Virtual Machine level at which isolation can be implemented involves running multiple Operating Systems on the same machine, effectively simulating the physical layer of isolation in software.",
18,Process,,,The process level at which isolation can be implemented involves separating multiple processes from one another within an operating system.,
19,Thread,,1029,The thread level at which isolation can be implemented involves separating multiple process threads from one another.,
20,Application,,1030,The application level at which isolation can be implemented involves separating high-level components from one another in software.,
21,Example/Methods,,,,
22,Security Mechanisms,"23,25",,Security Mechanisms are software engineering constructs that help to mitigate attacks on software security.,
23,Access Control,24,"1033,1034,1035",Access Control is the practice of restricting users specific abilities in the system,
24,Examples,,"1036,1037,1038",Different examples of security mechanisms and access control on various systems.,
25,Reference Monitors,26,,A design policy that keeps control and enforces access control.,
