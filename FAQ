How do I see what's in the database? In the backend?

  Run the command "rails console" which will take you to the rails console where
  you can interact with the database 2.

  You may need to specify RAILS_ENV if you are looking for a specific version of
  the database. The default environment is "development" and others options are
  "test" and "production". To findout when environment you are in while in the
  console, run "Rails.env"

  What's in the console you can query the database. Look in db/schema.rb to see
  how the database is structured. Tables are plural, but in the console it is
  singular, so to access all rows in the nodes table run "Node.all"

  For an overview on how to build a function to retrieve the information you
  want from the database go here:
